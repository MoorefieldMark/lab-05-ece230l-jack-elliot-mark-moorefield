## Lab Questions

### 1 - Explain the role of the Top Level file.
The top level file allows us to connect and use/call all of the other files that we have created. In this case it was equation a and equation b which we used in the top file to get the outputs we wanted. 

### 2 - Explain the function of the Constraints file.
The constraints file allows us to do a number of things like allowing the use of pins/switches/leds for input and output, and timing constraints (which we didn't do in this lab). For this labs purposes we used it to use switches and leds for our input and output. Without it we wouldn't be able to tell if our input or output was correct based off of the equations that we found from the k-maps.  

### 3 - Was the selection of Minterm and Maxterm correct for each circuit? What would you have chosen?
No the minterms and maxterms were not correct. Specifically for the first function it would have been a lot easier, and a lot more simplified if we had used the POS function instead of the SOP function which is what we were asked to do. The same goes for the second function where it would've been easier to to use the SOP instead of the POS. Using the opposite functions of what we found would've resulted in a more simplified circuit.
